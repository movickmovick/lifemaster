<h1>Declaration of Rights and Crimes</h1>

<p>It is hereby declared that JUSTIN-DAVID:MOVICK is now found dead in the law of Christiadom-spiritual-law given birth in a jurisdiction known as the land of the dead of the Islamic Umma. Officially given title and claimant to the rights and money coursing through it would be JOSTINE COLIN-MOVICK, androgen being, by the Grace of Mercy of Allah the most kind and the most compassionate.</p>

<p>I am freed from the demands of justice that would require my hand to be chopped off: I stole from my mother and burglarized two of my neighbors, I recorded illegally, I impeded agricultural research, and I moved a man’s markers. Thanks to the fact I live in America, I am free from Shariah law, though I do recognize its value in the world for wisdom's cause.</p>

<p>For the sake of my powerful passion in the light of Arthur McCrystle team of teams, I am one who has given shahada and am bound by this path and covenant to bear witness of the One and Only God whom I worship; nonetheless, culturally on a microscopic -gut-flora-level, I am technically a disobedient Muslim neither Muslim nor kaphir in another category which Muslim scholars have called, “Mun-Zée-Lá-BAY-EE-NAL-MUN-ZÉE-LA-TAY-YUN.”</p>
