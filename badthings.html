<h1>OFFICIAL HEAR YE HEAR YE</h1>

<p>I'm saying that JUSTIN-DAVID:MOVICK is found "dead": in the law of Christiadom-spiritual-law. "Fit, awake and straight" in a place known as the مون-زي-لا-باي-إي-نال-مون-زي-لا-تاي-يون of the Islamic Umma. Now, JOSTINE COLIN-MOVICK is the one who officially gets the rights and money there. This happens because Allah is kind and compassionate.</p>

<p>I did bad things like stealing from my mom and my neighbors, and doing other stuff against the law. But because I'm in America, I don't get punished like in Shariah law, even though I know it's good.</p>

<p>I believe in God, but some people might not think I'm a good Muslim because of some things I do.</p>

<p>I did a lot of bad things like stealing and hurting people. Here are some of the things I did:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transporting metal property (164.857)</li>
  <li>Transporting animal carcasses (164.863)</li>
  <li>Cutting trees without permission (164.825)</li>
  <li>Throwing trash in water or on land (164.775)</li>
  <li>Putting bad stuff in water or on land (164.785)</li>
  <li>Making a mess (164.805)</li>
  <li>Stealing (164.405)</li>
  <!-- and so on -->
</ul>

<p>I live at 18810 NW Shadow Lane, Portland, Oregon. It's a good place.</p>

<p>This is important.</p>
