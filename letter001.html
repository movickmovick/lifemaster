    <h1>Dear Jostine Colin-Movick,</h1>
    <p>In this make-believe world where you feel worried, weak, and reliant on others, finding happiness in simple things is important. Like making your clothes really clean, or keeping your space neat and tidy.</p>
    <p>But be careful of doing the same things every day, because it can make you feel safe but also make you forget what day it is. When I was in a place where time didn't seem to move, I made a calendar to remind me of the days. Losing track of time can make you feel lost and unhappy.</p>
    <p>When times get tough, try to stay positive and keep moving forward. There were moments when I felt really bad, but I never let myself give up. Giving up only leads to more problems.</p>
    <p>Stay strong, Jostine Colin-Movick. Every day, face your problems with courage and keep going. You're stronger than you know, and you can get through anything this world throws at you.</p>
    <p>Best wishes,<br>The zniverse</p>
