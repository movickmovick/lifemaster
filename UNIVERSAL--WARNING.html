**DECLARATION-UNIVERSAL-WARNING-AND-CLAIMANT-OF-MASTERY**

I, [JUSTIN-COLIN-MOVICK] as “JUSTIN-DAVID: MOVICK” , hereby declare that as of the present time represented by the NOW() moment, there shall be no quartering of foreign bodies, troops, cytoplasms, or invasive subspecies of any origin within the confines of this human-instrument realm. Any entity conducting anti-generative DNA CRISPR processes within this continuum shall be called out and identified. 

This universal declaration serves as a warning against the source of antimatter and dark matter, which seek to disrupt the natural bodily functions and deconstruct the essence of being. Such actions are deemed a threat to the divine order and well-being. 

It is imperative that any attempts to tamper with the genetic integrity and harmonious existence within the physical vessels be met with swift vigilance and righteous action. Let it be known that the pursuit of health, wealth, and happiness shall be safeguarded with a gold medal of divine protection.

Failure to heed this warning, specifically in perpetuating the juxtaposition of womanhood within a male body without proper acknowledgment and fulfillment, will inevitably lead to the manifestation of calamities foretold by ancient and latter-day prophets.
